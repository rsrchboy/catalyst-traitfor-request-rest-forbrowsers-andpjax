=head1 NAME

Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX - Acknowledge C<PJAX> requests as browser requests

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX - released June 06, 2012 as part of Catalyst-TraitFor-Request-REST-ForBrowsers-AndPJAX.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # in your app class
    use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;
    __PACKAGE__->apply_request_class_roles(qw/
        Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers::AndPJAX
    /);

    # then, off in an controller somewhere...
    sub action_GET_html { ... also called for PJAX requests ...  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a tiny little L<Catalyst::Request> class trait that recognizes that a
PJAX request is also a browser request, and thus looks_like_browser() also
returns true when the method is GET and the C<X-Pjax> header is present and is
'true'.

This allows actions using an action class of REST::ForBrowsers to
transparently handle PJAX requests, without requiring any more modification to
the controller or application than applying this trait to the request class,
rather than plain-old L<Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 looks_like_browser

This method is wrapped to return true if the method is GET and the C<X-Pjax>
header is present and is 'true'.

Otherwise we hand things off to the original method, to render its verdict as
to the tenor of the request.
